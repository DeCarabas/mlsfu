This is a small project that I used to crack apart MLS Northwest
results pages and mash them up with internet maps. Those results pages
were really crappy, and it was nice to plot them on an actual map. 

I never got very far with it, though, and I keep it hanging around
because it doesn't really impact my quota. :)

Redfin is really much better.
